GBA4iOS that you can easily sideload onto iOS 9 (up to 9.3 beta - what I currently have it running on). 


To run: `sudo gem install cocoapods; git clone https://github.com/shxl/GBA4iOS.git; cd GBA4iOS; pod install`.

Once the command is done running, open the .xcworkspace file, connect your phone and build the project.
